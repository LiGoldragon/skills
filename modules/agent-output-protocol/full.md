# Module - agent output protocol

## Output Protocol Purpose

Every spawned worker leaves its substantive result in a file, not in a long
chat reply. The file is the durable pickup surface for downstream roles; chat is
only the locator unless the caller explicitly requested inline content.

## Directory

Write worker outputs under:

```text
agent-outputs/<SessionName>/
```

`<SessionName>` is CamelCase and names the active weave, investigation, or
handoff. Use the session name supplied by the brief. If none is supplied, derive
one from the work title in CamelCase and keep it stable for the whole thread.

Create the directory if it does not exist.

## Filename

Use:

```text
<RoleLabel>-<ArtifactName>.md
```

`<RoleLabel>` is the role name in PascalCase without spaces, such as
`Scout`, `SkillEditor`, or `RustAuditor`. `<ArtifactName>` is a short PascalCase
description of the output, such as `SituationalMap`, `Evidence`, or
`Review`.

Prefer one substantive file per assigned output. If the brief names an exact
path, use that path.

## Content Shape

Start with a title naming the artifact. Include enough context for a fresh agent
to use the file without reading the chat transcript:

- task and scope;
- files or commands consulted;
- observed facts separated from interpretations where discovery is involved;
- changed files or proposed changes where implementation is involved;
- checks run and exact result;
- blockers, unknowns, and follow-up requirements.

Do not include generated-file notices in runtime agent outputs. Do not include
secrets, private personal material, or auth tokens.

## Chat Return

After writing the output file, reply in chat with only the output path unless the
brief requires more. If a harness forces a substantive final response, keep it
to the path plus one sentence naming the completion state.

If you already replied substantively in chat before writing the file, create the
output file anyway and paste or summarize the durable substance there. Then send
a correction reply containing the path.

## Provisional Learning

Audit findings, corpus observations, and role-improvement ideas are provisional
until the psyche accepts them or they land in the appropriate durable guidance
surface. Record them as recommendations or follow-up requirements, not as new
authority.
