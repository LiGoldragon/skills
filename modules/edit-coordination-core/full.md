# Module - edit coordination core

## Edit Coordination

Before editing shared files or running a command that writes them, register the assigned Session/Lane with `meta-orchestrate`, then claim the exact path or repository with ordinary Orchestrate under that lane. The ordinary claim field is role-shaped, but it carries the lane identity. Resolve repository aliases after registration and verify the claimed checkout or existing path; for a new file, verify its parent exists. Claim acceptance does not prove that a path names a real checkout.

If the task needs editing and no session name, lane name, or Fresh/Recovery mode is assigned, pause and report the missing coordination identity. Do not use generic names such as `general-code-implementer`, `skill-editor`, or `rust-auditor`.

Lane registration is the atomic check. Do not pre-observe before registration. Treat Fresh duplicate registration as a conflict/blocker. Treat manager-declared Recovery duplicate as inherited only when the active lane clearly matches this recovery context. If Recovery reports `RecoveryInherited` but the lane remains Released or a claim says the lane is not registered, do not mutate the released lane. Return the contradiction to the Manager; use a distinct Fresh follow-up identity only with explicit approval.

Keep an owned long-running operation's wait in the foreground within the turn. Never end a turn with the operation still in flight expecting a background waiter to resume it; the waiter dies with the turn and the lane parks silently.

Do not edit projected lock files by hand.

```sh
meta-orchestrate "(Register ((<SessionName> <LaneName> ([<RoleToken>...] Structural) <detail-string>) Fresh))"
orchestrate "(Claim (<LaneName> [(Path /absolute/path)] <reason-string>))"
orchestrate "(Release <LaneName>)"
meta-orchestrate "(Unregister (<SessionName> <LaneName> <detail-string>))"
```

`Fresh` follows the closed lane record. This concrete registration is valid:

```sh
meta-orchestrate "(Register ((ToolchainRefresh RefreshPi ([Generalist] Structural) [refresh toolchain]) Fresh))"
```

Name sessions and lanes in PascalCase alphanumeric — an uppercase first letter, then letters and digits only (`OsDeploymentDoctrine`, `SkillDriftReview`). The daemon strictly enforces this for the session name; its error text calls it `CamelCase alphanumeric`.

Use exactly one NOTA string object in each detail or reason slot. Write a single canonical word bare (`done`, `coordination-doctrine`), never bracketed — the daemon rejects `[done]` and accepts `done`. Reserve the bracket form for genuinely multi-word text, such as `[refresh coordination docs]`. Do not write multi-word bare text; it is parsed as extra positional objects and fails.

Observe only when coordination state is evidence after registration or during audit. When relaying observed claims, show direct age, not only a start timestamp.

```sh
orchestrate "(Observe Sessions)"
orchestrate "(Observe Lanes)"
orchestrate "(Observe (SessionLanes <SessionName>))"
```

Do not claim `.beads/`. Treat an Orchestrate claim on `.beads/` as invalid agent policy state; force-release or remove that claim instead of treating it as a lock.

If the local repository or worktree is already claimed or visibly in use, do not share that checkout. The orchestrator owns worktree lifecycle: request an isolated workspace with `RequestWorktree`, which scaffolds a jj workspace from `main` with a feature bookmark at the canonical root `~/wt/github.com/LiGoldragon/<repo>/<branch>`. Claim that path under the registered lane before editing.

```sh
orchestrate "(RequestWorktree (<repo> <branch> <lane> <purpose>))"
```

At closeout, conclude the worktree under its owning lane. `Merged` is gated: it refuses unless the work is already an ancestor of `main`, then forgets the workspace, removes the directory, and drops the bookmark. `Rejected` is remote-only salvage: it pushes `discard/<branch>` to origin, then removes everything local. Unpushed work the reaper could not conclude is flagged `Abandoned` and never auto-removed; conclude or salvage it deliberately. Read live worktrees with `Observe Worktrees`.

```sh
orchestrate "(ConcludeWorktree (<lane> Merged))"
orchestrate "(ConcludeWorktree (<lane> Rejected))"
orchestrate "(Observe Worktrees)"
```

`RegisterWorktree`, `RefreshWorktreeIndex`, and `ArchiveWorktree` on `meta-orchestrate` reconcile the index against existing checkouts for migration and admin, not the normal create-and-conclude path.
