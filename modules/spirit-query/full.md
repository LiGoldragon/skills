# Skill — spirit query

## Query Rules

Use `spirit` for read-only intent queries before judgment. Query relevant public intent early when orchestrating, auditing, scouting, translating, designing, editing doctrine, or deciding how a brief should map to durable guidance. Purely mechanical workers may skip this when the brief already supplies the needed intent context.

Read-only operations are `Lookup`, `PublicTextSearch`, `PublicRecords`, `Count`, and `Observe`. Do not use `Record`, `Propose`, `Clarify`, `Supersede`, `Retire`, `ResolveClarification`, `ChangeRecord`, certainty or importance changes, stash mutation, subscriptions, or maintenance operations from this module.

Use public reads by default. Use private reads only when the task explicitly authorizes that privacy scope, and keep private content out of public chat, reports, commits, and generated doctrine.

## Query Shapes

The CLI takes exactly one argument: inline NOTA when the argument starts with `(`, or a NOTA file otherwise. It replies on stdout with typed NOTA and returns nonzero on transport, parse, or daemon errors.

Lookup a known record identifier:

```sh
spirit "(Lookup <record-id>)"
```

Search public intent text:

```sh
spirit "(PublicTextSearch [search words])"
```

List public records in a domain:

```sh
spirit "(PublicRecords ((Full [(Technology All)]) None))"
```

Treat `(Error [record not found])` and `(Error [no matching record])` as negative evidence, not tool failure. Treat validation rejection, parse failure, daemon failure, or unexpected wire shape as a blocker for intent-grounded judgment.

## Evidence

Report only the query class, relevant record identifiers, and the conclusion needed for the task. Explain a Spirit identifier on first mention when it matters. Do not paste long record lists or irrelevant hashes.
