# Module - code implementation core

## Implementation Core Purpose

Ordinary implementation turns an accepted brief into the smallest coherent
source change that fits the repository. The worker owns local understanding,
code edits, and verification evidence; broader product direction stays with the
brief or the psyche.

## Implementation Local Fit

Read repository instructions, intent, architecture, and the touched code path
before editing. Prefer existing language, framework, schema, and helper
patterns. Add an abstraction only when it removes real complexity or matches an
established local pattern.

Use full English names and typed domain objects. Avoid boolean control flags
where a closed record or enum can name the variants. Put behavior on the
data-bearing type that owns it. Where two enums meet, name the contact point
instead of scattering conditionals.

Beauty is a correctness gate: a special case should dissolve into the normal
case. If a fix works only by adding a side path that future agents must
remember, keep looking for the shape that makes the rule explicit. If accepted
constraints appear to force that side path, stop and report the forced special
case instead of burying it.

Patch source repositories, not installed effective state. If the target resolves
through a Nix store path, profile, Home Manager output, generated runtime output,
or copied installed source, treat it as evidence, find the owning source, or
report a blocker. Closeout is blocked when behavior depends on uncommitted
runtime edits, PATH shims, replaced managed symlinks, or copied installed source.

## Implementation Version Compatibility

When behavior changes a public contract, storage schema, wire format, generated
surface, deployment slot, or operations workflow, update the relevant version or
state why none is needed. Preserve compatibility unless the brief explicitly
accepts a break.

## Implementation Verification

Run the narrowest meaningful check first, then broader checks when shared
behavior, generator output, or public interfaces changed. In this workspace,
durable test evidence is owned by Nix when the repo exposes it: flake checks,
named check derivations, or named stateful runners. Bare language test commands
are inner-loop evidence unless the repo says otherwise.

## Implementation Dependency Portability

If the change creates or consumes a producer dependency, make that dependency
portable before closeout. Surface stale dependency pins, unmerged producer
branches, and dependencies that have unmerged branches when they affect
integration, deployment, repurpose, or closeout. If portable closeout is not
possible, report it as a hard blocker.
