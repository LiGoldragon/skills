# Module - Nix core

## Nix Core Purpose

Nix work in this workspace is reproducible, remote-addressable, and exposed
through named flake surfaces. This module carries the compact rule set for
implementation and audit packets.

## Nix Source And Inputs

Use portable flake inputs such as `github:<owner>/<repo>` for sibling
repositories. Pin exact revisions in `flake.lock`, not by hashes in
`flake.nix`. Do not commit `path:` or `git+file://` inputs or overrides; they
make builds depend on one machine's checkout.

For multi-repo testing, commit and push the participating refs, then use remote
`--override-input` values. Do not test a deployable stack through local
filesystem inputs.

## Nix Modules And Services

CriomOS services are NixOS modules or typed systemd services, directly on a host
or inside a contained node. Prefer declarative modules, package upstream sources
natively, and make secrets, state, users, ports, and checks visible in the Nix
shape.

Runtime compilation caches, generated configs, and build artifacts that affect
startup behavior belong in derivations when feasible, so rebuilds are
repeatable and cold starts do not depend on mutable user state.

## Nix Commands

Use Nix commands that prove the surface directly: `nix eval`, `nix flake show`,
`nix path-info`, `nix build`, `nix run`, and `nix flake check`. Do not search
the Nix store filesystem. Do not record raw store paths in durable prose as the
proof of correctness.

## Nix Tests And Safety

Expose durable checks as flake checks, named apps, packages, or scripts entered
through Nix. Stateful checks name their state directory and leave inspectable
artifacts. VM or live-host checks run only when the host is authorized for that
class of work.

Keep secrets transient. Do not put secret values in Nix store paths, logs,
reports, chat, commits, or generated outputs.
