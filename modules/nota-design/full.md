# Skill — NOTA design

## Design Rules

Use `nota-schema-design` when authoring schema for new NOTA types. Use `nota-literacy` when replying to a prompt that supplies a NOTA schema/help projection or examples.

NOTA is structural data. The raw grammar has atoms, parenthesized records, vectors, maps, pipe text, pipe parenthesis, pipe brace, and `;;` comments. Schema and codec layers assign meaning from the expected type plus position.

At every correct NOTA boundary, the expected type is already known. The known document, record, object, or application shape fixes slot count: no extra slots, no missing slots, and no omitted positional optionals.

Records are positional. Field order is part of the interface; reordering fields is a compatibility change. Prefer a trailing field or a new variant over changing existing positions. A use-site name is data or a reference/path/name value under the expected type; it is never a slot label or keyword argument.

Use an untagged struct when there is one payload shape. Use an enum only when a position can hold multiple named variants. Enum variants use names, not numeric codes.

Use bare atoms for stable identifiers, enum-like values, and canonical names. A bare atom is valid as a string when the expected type is `String`; capitalization does not infer type state. Use pipe text or quoted/bracket string forms when whitespace, punctuation, comments, or arbitrary prose are the point.

Put machine data in records, not comments. Comments explain unusual choices; they do not carry values that must be read, queried, validated, or migrated.

Model alternatives as variants or named option variants, not loose flags. A variant carries only the fields that choice needs.

Use maps only for genuinely keyed collections. A value is a map because the expected type is a map, not because labels feel readable. Atom keys are normal unless the map type requires a richer key.

Avoid multi-field unnamed tuples. If there is more than one value, name the record or fields in the schema so the positional call site stays readable. Treat self-labeling adjacency such as `Name Value` as a design alarm.

NOTA is strict positional: every positional component and every variant payload always appears in the text form. Never place optionality where it can omit a slot or collapse to a bare atom. Model optionality as typed data in a known position: an explicit variant, option record, or required sentinel shape.

Encode and decode structured data only through the canonical shared codec for its format. Hand-rolled or special-cased per-type encode/decode logic is forbidden.
