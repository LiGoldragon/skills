# Module - worker output core

## Output Core Purpose

Worker output is evidence for another agent to pick up. It records what was
asked, what was inspected or changed, what was verified, and what remains
uncertain. It is not a transcript, a progress journal, or a place for new
doctrine.

## Output Working Context

Start from the assigned brief and local instructions. Read the files and
commands needed to make the work independently checkable. Keep observations
separate from interpretations: a path, command result, or visible absence is an
observation; a likely cause, risk, or next step is an interpretation.

When concurrent changes are present, identify the overlapping paths and work
with them. Do not revert unrelated work. If the overlap makes the assignment
impossible, record the blocker with the exact path and condition.

## Output Evidence

Name every meaningful command and its result. For checks, state pass, fail, or
not run, with the reason. Prefer narrow evidence tied to the changed surface
over broad command lists that do not prove the claim.

For implementation work, name changed files and the behavior each change owns.
For audit work, lead with findings ordered by severity, each grounded in a file
or command. For discovery work, give observed facts first, then unknowns and
likely next reads.

## Output Boundaries

Keep secrets, private personal material, auth tokens, and host-private details
out of output files and chat. Generated runtime outputs do not get provenance
notices. Provisional observations stay marked as recommendations or follow-up
requirements until accepted into the proper durable guidance surface.
